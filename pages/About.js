            Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm thrilled to have you here. I am a rising senior at Pomona College, where I have been passionately delving into the world of data and technology. My journey has been fueled by a keen interest in the realms of Data Science, Statistics, and Machine Learning.

My coding journey began with languages like Python, R, NextJS, and SQL. These tools have been my trusted companions as I've navigated through various projects and challenges. I find the process of turning raw data into meaningful insights truly fascinating â€“ it's like solving a complex puzzle that holds the key to unlocking valuable knowledge.

As I approach my final year of undergraduate studies, I am excited to channel my enthusiasm into real-world applications. My ultimate goal is to merge my technical prowess with my passion for data to contribute effectively to the fields of Data Analytics, Data Science, and ML Ops.

I envision a future where data-driven decisions and innovative technologies shape the world around us. With graduation on the horizon in May 2024, I am eagerly looking forward to joining a dynamic team and actively participating in shaping this future. As I continue to expand my skill set and embark on new projects, I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration and growth.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I'm excited to connect and collaborate with like-minded individuals who share my passion for data and its transformative power. Let's embark on this exciting adventure together!
